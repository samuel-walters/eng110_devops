# What is virtualisation (Vagrant - VirtualBox)?

Virtualisation is the act of creating a virtual or simulated (as opposed to an actual) version of something such as a virtual machine that acts like a real computer with an operating system. Software executed on these virtual machines is separated from the underlying hardware resources. For example, a computer that is running Microsoft Windows may host a virtual machine that looks like a computer with the Ubuntu Linux operating system.

There are tools which can automate the process of setting up virtual machines (VMs). Vagrant, for example, enables automation since it uses VirtualBox (software that creates a VM) along with any scripts the developer creates to automatically set up and configure an environment. This saves a great deal of time since manually setting up and configuring a VM is not a trivial or short process.

# What is Dev Env?

A development environment is a computer system in which a computer program is deployed and executed. Development environments enable developers to create and innovate without breaking something in a live environment. It also means that if all the developers share the same development environment, the program will work the same way no matter whose machine it is running on.

It is also worth saying that the development environment enables the automation of manual processes involved in developing, testing, debugging, patching, updating and maintaining the application.
