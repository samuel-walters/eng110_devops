# What is DevOps

DevOps is a combination of cultural philosophies, practices and tools that
allow a company to shorten its software development lifecycle (SDL) while still
providing high-quality software through the processes of continuous integration
and continuous deployment.

# Why DevOps

Traditionally, there were two separate teams which handled software development and
IT operations. However, this led to silos where the two teams started blaming one another
whenever problems arose. DevOps bridges this gap between the teams, eliminating blame
culture as everyone will be united under one single team. The lack of friction ensures 
everyone can really focus upon what is important: releasing and maintaining high-quality
software at a competitive pace.

# Benefits of DevOps

* Ensures the release of high-quality software at a fast pace due to the use of automated
tools and the elimination of silos. 
* A member of the DevOps team can oversee the whole software development lifecycle,
meaning there is someone who always has the bigger picture in mind so they can accurately
assess whether the the needs of the customer are being met.
* Automation leaves more room for innovation. As flaws get repeatedly tested through 
automation, there is more time to frame new ideas and enhance existing user features. 

# DevOps Four Key Pillars

* Ease of use

Automation is the soul of DevOps. No time has to be wasted on traditionally difficult and time-consuming tasks. 

* Flexibility 

Having an ability to extend and replace the existing tool sets, DevOps teams can easily adapt
to the situation at hand.

* Robustness

DevOps allows an environment for seamless communication to exist since it unites what were once
two separate teams. This means individual members can overcome any problems they may face by sharing
them quickly and effortlessly with the rest of the group.

Furthermore, by being willing to pick up new automated tools and replace old technologies, a DevOps team 
can quickly adapt to any challenges they face. 

* Cost-effective

DevOps reduces the cost of computation by ensuring the company only pays for resources when they are using them. 
They can do this by leveraging serverless infrastructure like AWS Lambda or GCP Functions.

Moreover, automation cuts down on the costs associated with the volume of manual work as the DevOps team can
use automated tools and work seamlessly with one another to build, test and deploy faster than previously possible.
