# What is virtualisation (Vagrant - VirtualBox)?

Virtualisation creates a simulated or virtual computing environment, as opposed to a physical environment. Tools like Vagrant allow developers to automate the process of creating virtual machines so that what works on one person's machine will work the same way on another person's machine. 

Vagrant enables automation since it uses VirtualBox (software that creates a VM) along with any scripts the developer creates to automatically set up and configure an environment that fits the needs of the team. This saves a great deal of time since manually setting up and configuring a virtual environment is not a trivial and short process.

# What is Dev Env?

A development environment is a computer system in which a computer program is deployed and executed. Development environments enable developers to create and innovate without breaking something in a live environment.

The development environment enables the automation of manual processes involved in developing, testing, debugging, patching, updating and maintaining the application.
