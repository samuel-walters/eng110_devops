# What is DevOps

DevOps is a combination of cultural philosophies, practices and tools that
allow a company to shorten its software development lifecycle (SDL) while still
providing high-quality software through the processes of continuous integration
and continuous deployment.

## Why DevOps

Traditionally, there were two separate teams which handled software development and
IT operations. However, this led to silos where the two teams started blaming one another
whenever problems arise. DevOps bridges this gap between the teams, eliminating blame
culture as everyone will be united under one single team. The lack of friction ensures 
everyone can really focus upon what is important: releasing and maintaining high-quality
software at a competitive pace.

## Benefits of DevOps

* Ensures the release of high-quality software at a fast pace due to the use of automated
tools and the elimination of silos. 
* A member of the DevOps team can oversee the whole software development lifecycle,
meaning there is someone who always has the bigger picture in mind so they can accurately
assess whether the the needs of the customer are being met.
* Automation leaves more room for innovation. As flaws get repeatedly tested through 
automation, there is more time to frame new ideas and enhance existing user features.
